i have a listview inside an activity and each of its item is customized to have some textviews along with a dropdownlist item and an imageview inside an onscrolllistener implementation each item of a listview gets populated using an arrayadapter populating text views with values taken from an arraylist and imageview with the jpeg file stored on sd card following is the screenshot of listview item the problem arises when the jpeg file from sdcard is converted to a bitmap i e bitmapfactory decodefile filename and then gets assigned to an image view using setimagebitmap bitmap bmp as the setting bitmap image to an image view is a lengthy process it cannot keep pace with the scroll listener implementation and the imageview of different listview rows gets populated with the image it was assigned to any row above can anybody please suggest some workout to cater this issue specifically the assignment of images from sd card to an imageview its not like my listview item is overloaded with controls that is why i am facing this problem i also have tried it with single imageview item inside each row and it behaves the same way your suggestion to improvise this are welcome and surely

the probably not so well written question is is there any way to get object data right after it is loaded through bpy import_scene obj function i mean when i import an obj file with this function i need to make some more transformation for it when i select an object via name mesh default name of object after import all those functions works for other objects named mesh in my scene i tried to get an last object from objects list in scene but they re arranged alphabeticaly so it didn t worked well when i tried to change object name and apply next functions to it it works only for one all earlier instances of imported object are back to default how to solve that problem is there a option to get from scene last added object or maybe some way to mark obj object right after it is imported before next functions are applied or maybe there is a way to import obj data straight into created earlier blank object cheers regg ps working on blender 2 63 	python

i recently did some digging into memory and how to use it properly of course i also stumbled upon prefetching and how i can make life easier for the cpu i ran some benchmarks to see the actual benefits of proper storage access of data and instructions these benchmarks showed not only the expected benefits of helping your cpu prefetch it also showed that prefetching also speeds up the process during runtime after about 100 program cycles the cpu seems to have figured it out and has optimized the cache accordingly this saves me up to 200 000 ticks per cycle the number drops from around 750 000 to 550 000 i got these numbers using the qtestlib now to the question is there a safe way to use this runtime speedup letting it warm up so to speak or should one not calculate this in at all and just build faster code from the start up 	c++

i have an application which uses a boost interprocess map in shared memory the map contains a large number of elements 100k to 10m and everything works pretty well with one exception the map has to be cleared periodically and this seems to take around 4 s per element so 40 seconds worst case which is unacceptable for the application it looks like clear actually deletes each map element individually and rebalances the tree after each deletion so it s horrendously inefficient when you have a large number of elements ideally clear would just delete all the elements without any rebalancing is there any way i can implement this kind of optimised clear method myself incidentally i ve also tried boost interprocess flat_map this has a much faster clear time as might be expected 10x faster but it s too slow for insert delete operations note an earlier question on stackoverflow touched on a similar problem with smaller stl maps in normal i e not shared memory but didn t really resolve the problem 	c++
the documentation simply says readblock is a blocking version of read but what does that mean someone else has asked the question before but huh http www pcreview co uk forums thread 1385785 php the guy answering said basically it means that you can rely on streamreader readblock not returning until either it s read as much as you ve asked it to or it s reached the end of the stream am i understanding correctly that this is required because read may not give you everything you asked for and that just because it returns 0 does not mean you reached the end of the file so this means check something other than the number of bytes returned endofstream or use readblock instead 	c#

my users report a crash that occurs when they try to pick a widget with my application not a launcher app i m using the standard widget picker code and it always worked and still works on all devices except on lg g2 and lg g3 i ve found some similar questions but they all refer to the crash that android 2 1 suffered from that was solved with the empty data workaround which is already implemented in my code also used an alternative way to get the widgets without the official picker which works but requires the app to be a system app for the bind_appwidget permission anyone experienced this

i have the situation that i need to numpy digitize an array say the code is my_bin_list 3 6 9 my_array np array 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 digitized numpy digitize my_array my_bins this works just fine however the problem is that i do not have one list of bins like in the example but exactly one bin list per element in my_array because each element belongs to a different dataset that has its own bins so that len my_array len list_of_my_bin_lists here is list_of_my_bin_lists my_bin_list1 my_bin_list2 so i need to tell digitize that for the first array element it should check into which bin of list_of_my_bin_lists 0 that element belongs for the second element with list_of_my_bin_lists 1 and so on is that possible i would imagine something like list_of_my_bin_lists 2 6 9 4 6 8 3 5 9 my_array np array 1 3 7 digitized numpy digitize my_array i my_bins i for i in len my_array which would have to return for digitized 0 0 2 	python

my app didn t have any crash until ios 7 1 came out now on any removefromsuperview method crash for example i got view controllers and when i want to remove a view controller i remove all of its subviews and then remove from the stack stack i m storing view controllers in this for load new contents and load previous contents for uiview subview in contentvc subviews subview removefromsuperview and i got calayer retain message sent to deallocated instance message actual removefromparentviewcontroller is a good way to remove it and will it release the whole view controller and its subviews because instead of removefromsuperview my app doesn t crash i don t understand what have been changed in ios 7 1 and how can i remove all subviews in a viewcontroller without removefromsuperview and without remove my viewcontroller if i just want to add new subviews and remove the currently content update sometimes crash for myactualviewcontroller view removefromsuperview calayer retain message sent to deallocated instance why and sometimes if i try to remove the main subview from the view controller view its got the same crash mainview removefromsuperview mainview is a single uiview added to the vc view update2 well detailed so i ve got a container view i m adding a uiviewcontroller view to this container and i m adding a view as a subview to uiviewcontroller view this view is not a local uiview i mean its declared as implementation uiview mainview when my uiviewcontroller will be deallocate in its void dealloc mainview removefromsuperview mainview release super dealloc at the mainview removefromsuperview my app crash 	ios

i have an enum with a custom attribute marking the items enum mycolourenum renderas ff0000 red renderas 00ff00 green then i create an expression tree that uses the enum expression lt func lt environment bool gt gt expr _ gt _ colour mycolourenum red i then parse the expression tree and translate it into a string representation of the expression the resulting string that i want is environment colour ff0000 the problem i have is that the enum value gets turned into a constant within the lambda so when looking at the expression tree it sees the constant value 0 instead of an expression reading the red item of the enum i want to use the custom attribute to identify the enum as a special case and replace it s value with the one attached to the attribute but i can t because all i can see is the constant 0 value how can i get the enum used to create the constant within the expression tree if you can t then how else can i do something similar 	c#

i am using jquery ui s autocomplete plugin and everything is well and good except for that fact that when a user clicks the value they want the function i have assigned to the select method fires before the value of the field is changed so if i type foo in the input field then click the autocomplete match for foo bar the function detects the value as what was typed in this case foo as opposed to the value which was selected from the autocomplete list once the function fires in this case i just have an alert box popup w this value the value of the input field is set to the value selected via the autocomplete list this problem does not occur if the user selects the option w the keyboard arrow keys tab only when the mouse is used function var aemps lt php echo semps gt slast bind keydown function event if event keycode ui keycode tab amp amp this data autocomplete menu active event preventdefault autocomplete source aemps select function event ui var aname this val alert aname since most users will be interacting with this using their mouse i have to find a way to get the value set before firing the select function i believe i can accomodate for this by adding a condition to the statement prior to the auto complete but i need some help finding the right syntax 	javascript jquery

the purpose of this mathematical function is to compute a distance between two or more protein structures using dihedral angles it is very useful in structural biology for example and i already code this function in python using numpy but the goal is to have a faster implementation as computation time reference i use the euclidean distance function available in the scikit learn package here the code i have for the moment import numpy as np import numexpr as ne from sklearn metrics pairwise import euclidean_distances we have 10000 structures with 100 dihedral angles n 10000 m 100 generate some random data c np random rand n m generate random int number x np random randint c shape 0 print c shape x first version with numpy of the dihedral_distances function def dihedral_distances a b l 1 a shape 0 return np sqrt l np sum 0 5 1 np cos a b axis 1 accelerated version with numexpr def dihedral_distances_ne a b l 1 a shape 0 tmp ne evaluate sum 0 5 1 cos a b axis 1 return ne evaluate sqrt l tmp the function of reference i try to be close as possible in term of computation time timeit euclidean_distances c x c 0 1000 loops best of 3 1 07 ms per loop computation time of the first version of the dihedral_distances function we choose randomly 1 structure among the 10000 structures and we compute the dihedral distance between this one and the others timeit dihedral_distances c x c 10 loops best of 3 21 5 ms per loop computation time of the accelerated function with numexpr timeit dihedral_distances_ne c x c 100 loops best of 3 9 44 ms per loop 9 44 ms it s very fast but it s very slow if you need to run it a million times now the question is how to do that what is the next step cython pyopencl i have some experience with pyopencl however i never code something as elaborate as this one i don t know if it s possible to compute the dihedral distances in one step on gpu as i do with numpy and how to proceed thank you for helping me edit thank you guys i am currently working on the full solution and once it s finished i will put the code here cython version load_ext cython import numpy as np np random seed 1234 n 10000 m 100 c np random rand n m x np random randint c shape 0 print c shape x cython compile args fopenmp link args fopenmp force import numpy as np cimport numpy as np from libc math cimport sqrt cos cimport cython from cython parallel cimport parallel prange define a function pointer to a metric ctypedef double metric double 1 np intp_t np intp_t cdef extern from math h nogil double cos double x double sqrt double x cython boundscheck false cython wraparound false cython cdivision true cdef double dihedral_distances double 1 a np intp_t i1 np intp_t i2 cdef double res cdef int m cdef int j res 0 m a shape 1 for j in range m res + 1 cos a i1 j a i2 j res 2 m return sqrt res cython boundscheck false cython wraparound false cython cdivision true cdef double dihedral_distances_p double 1 a np intp_t i1 np intp_t i2 cdef double res cdef int m cdef int j res 0 m a shape 1 with nogil parallel num_threads 2 for j in prange m schedule dynamic res + 1 cos a i1 j a i2 j res 2 m return sqrt res cython boundscheck false cython wraparound false def pairwise double 1 c not none np intp_t x p true cdef metric dist_func if p dist_func amp dihedral_distances_p else dist_func amp dihedral_distances cdef np intp_t i n_structures n_samples c shape 0 cdef double 1 res np empty n_samples for i in range n_samples res i dist_func c x i return res timeit pairwise c x false 100 loops best of 3 17 ms per loop parallel version timeit pairwise c x true 10 loops best of 3 37 1 ms per loop so i follow your link to create the cython version of the dihedral distances function we gain some speed not so much but it is still slower than the numexpr version 17ms vs 9 44ms so i tried to parallelize the function using prange and it is worse 37 1ms vs 17ms vs 9 4ms do i miss something 	python

i need to compute a product vector matrix as efficiently as possible specifically given a vector s and a matrix a i need to compute s a i have a class vector which wraps a std vector and a class matrix which also wraps a std vector for efficiency the naive approach the one that i am using at the moment is to have something like vector lt t gt timesmatrix matrix lt t gt amp matrix vector lt unsigned int gt result matrix columns constructor that does a resize on the underlying std vector for unsigned int i 0 i lt vector size ++i for unsigned int j 0 j lt matrix columns ++j result j + vector i matrix getelementat i j getelementat accesses the appropriate entry of the underlying std vector return result it works fine and takes nearly 12000 microseconds note that the vector s has 499 elements while a is 499 x 15500 the next step was trying to parallelize the computation if i have n threads then i can give each thread a part of the vector s and the corresponding rows of the matrix a each thread will compute a 499 sized vector and the final result will be their entry wise sum first of all in the class matrix i added a method to extract some rows from a matrix and build a smaller one matrix lt t gt extractsomerows unsigned int start unsigned int end unsigned int rowstoextract end start + 1 std vector lt t gt tmp tmp reserve rowstoextract numcolumns for unsigned int i start numcolumns i lt end+1 numcolumns ++i tmp push_back matrix i return matrix lt t gt rowstoextract numcolumns tmp then i defined a thread routine void timesmatrixthreadroutine matrix lt t gt amp matrix unsigned int start unsigned int end vector lt t gt amp newrow newrow is supposed to contain the partial result computed by a thread newrow resize matrix columns for unsigned int i start i lt end + 1 ++i for unsigned int j 0 j lt matrix columns ++j newrow j + vector i matrix getelementat i start j and finally i modified the code of the timesmatrix method that i showed above vector lt t gt timesmatrix matrix lt t gt amp matrix static const unsigned int num_threads 4 unsigned int matrows matrix rows unsigned int matcolumns matrix columns unsigned int rowseachthread vector size num_threads std thread threads num_threads vector lt t gt tmp num_threads unsigned int start end all but the last thread for unsigned int i 0 i lt num_threads 1 ++i start i rowseachthread end i+1 rowseachthread 1 threads i std thread amp vector lt t gt timesmatrixthreadroutine this matrix extractsomerows start end start end std ref tmp i last thread start num_threads 1 rowseachthread end matrows 1 threads num_threads 1 std thread amp vector lt t gt timesmatrixthreadroutine this matrix extractsomerows start end start end std ref tmp num_threads 1 for unsigned int i 0 i lt num_threads ++i threads i join vector lt unsigned int gt result matcolumns for unsigned int i 0 i lt num_threads ++i result result + tmp i the operator+ is overloaded return result it still works but now it takes nearly 30000 microseconds which is almost three times as much as before am i doing something wrong do you think there is a better approach edit using a lightweight virtualmatrix following ilya ovodov s suggestion i defined a class virtualmatrix that wraps a t matrixdata which is initialized in the constructor as virtualmatrix matrix lt t gt amp m numrows m rows numcolumns m columns matrixdata m pointertodata pointertodata returns underlyingvector data then there is a method to retrieve a specific entry of the matrix inline t getelementat unsigned int row unsigned int column return matrixdata + row numcolumns + column now the execution time is better approximately 8000 microseconds but maybe there are some improvements to be made in particular the thread routine is now void timesmatrixthreadroutine virtualmatrix lt t gt amp matrix unsigned int startrow unsigned int endrow vector lt t gt amp newrow unsigned int matcolumns matrix columns newrow resize matcolumns for unsigned int i startrow i lt endrow + 1 ++i for unsigned int j 0 j lt matcolumns ++j newrow j + vector i matrix getelementat i j and the really slow part is the one with the nested for loops if i remove it the result is obviously wrong but is computed in less than 500 microseconds this to say that now passing the arguments takes almost no time and the heavy part is really the computation according to you is there any way to make it even faster 	c++

i m talking about t5 java 1 7 i can not find any enough detailed tutorial about using hibernate inside tapestry services what i need is to create tapestry service which could deal with hibernate independently this could be scheduler service for example this service will deal with some objects and their state in db and work in background of application the question is how correctly bind it with hibernate which object of hibernate should be injected for further work inside this service the current approach is to inject inside this service a hibernatesessionsource object passing its instance through constructor of service and then manually create sessions begin the transactions and so on e g public synchronized void deletejob long id session session hss create jobitem job jobitem session get jobitem class id if job null transaction tx session begintransaction try session delete job tx commit catch hibernateexception e tx rollback finally session close it looks very ugly not in style of tapestry what it is the smart approach 	java

i am currently working on a grid based game map prototype each tile is 24px by 24px and the script draws out 31 x based tiles and 21 y based tiles for a total of 651 tiles on the screen the problem i m having is that the way i have my script going it s making a database call for every single tile that s drawn at every page refresh meaning it s making 651 database calls to check what the tile is and the coordinates of the tile to me this seems obscenely inefficient the x and y coordinates are stored in a session variable when the user clicks one of the directional buttons below the map it offsets the appropriate coordinate accordingly and redraws the map if i were to create a game based on the logic i m using and playing the number game let s hypothetically say i ve got 100 players playing the game at any one time and they re all browsing through the map i would have 65 100 database calls simultaneously that can t be good for system resources i am not a noob when it comes to php mysql programming as i have created and launched a few different browser based games however this is my first venture into generating a map and navigating around it the tile map can be viewed here http fordserver com gamemap the actual code for this can be found here http fordserver com gamemap index txt can anyone recommend a good way to get this running more smoothly you ll notice that when using one of the directional buttons that the game can take quite awhile to generate the actual map especially if you are just visiting it for the first time i ve tried to think of different ways to use arrays and everything else but really the game needs to check the database for each individual tile as i plan to incorporate functions so that it shows where a specific user currently is or a building etc i appreciate any help i can get with this ricky 	php

let s supposed we ve got a ring with inner radius r2 and outer radius r1 according documentation inner radius of the ring expressed as a ratio of the ring s width for instance if innerradiusratio 9 then the inner radius equals the ring s width divided by 9 as i understand this means that innerradiusratio 2 r1 r2 about thicknessratio there is that thickness of the ring expressed as a ratio of the ring s width for instance if thicknessratio 3 then the thickness equals the ring s width divided by 3 so thicknessratio 2 r1 r1 r2 from this two equation we can get this one thicknessratio 1 2 innerradiusratio 2 which means that there is a connection between thicknessratio and innerradiusratio but there is nothing about this connection in gradientdrawable class documentation and it doesn t seem that there is any connections between them as i can set thicknessratio and innerradiusratio which doesn t satisfying last equation so tell me please where i m wrong in my consideration or what are this parameters really responsible for 	android

this is more of a general understanding question rather than a specific senario question i have been lookiing at the ways in which jpa maps tables together and found two examples here that seem to work in different ways one has a set of phone objects using jointable to join student_phone to student by student_id the other has a set of stockdailyrecord but seems to just use mappedby stock and in the stock_detail table object have the primarykeyjoincolumn annotation simply trying to get an understanding of which method would be the prefered way and why method 1 onetomany cascade cascadetype all jointable name student_phone joincolumns joincolumn name student_id inversejoincolumns joincolumn name phone_id public set lt phone gt getstudentphonenumbers return this studentphonenumbers method 2 table name stock catalog mkyongdb uniqueconstraints uniqueconstraint columnnames stock_name uniqueconstraint columnnames stock_code onetomany fetch fetchtype lazy mappedby stock public set lt stockdailyrecord gt getstockdailyrecords return this stockdailyrecords table name stock_detail catalog mkyongdb onetoone fetch fetchtype lazy primarykeyjoincolumn public stock getstock return this stock 	java

i have tried to configure declarative transaction management within my spring based web application and it refuses to cooperate with me i have two main problems setting defaultautocommit to false on our datasource which we need for our application causes all queries to rollback with or without transactions being involved transactions are configured and proxy classes as well as transactional methods are created however no transactions appear to be used the first problem is rather perplexing as every individual query is being rolled back in the database this includes select statements as well what could cause every query to be rolled back in the database as for the second problem my configuration of the transaction management is outlined below applicationcontext xml lt xml version 1 0

that i have visited in trying to solve this problem i believe that my configuration should be correct however i do not fully understand aop and spring transactions so i may be missing something crucial as alluded to above i can trace through my logs and see proxies as well as transactional methods being created for my service classes however when i actually run the application and trace through the logs i don t see any statements dealing with the datasourcetransactionmanager or transactions being created committed rolled back etc it would appear to me that nothing is actually being run and i am terribly confused as i have followed many different tutorials and tried this many different ways but it always ends up with this situation i am also fairly certain that i have my log4j properties set up correctly to receive messages from the datasourcetransactionmanager but i am supplying them below to make sure that it is not just a logging error on my part my log4j is set up with the following loggers to try and trace through the transactions log4j logger org springframework info file log4j logger org springframework jdbc datasource debug file log4j logger org springframework transaction debug file note i ran the top logger on debug at one point and that is where i verified that the service proxies were being created does anyone have any insights into what might be happening i am rather stuck at the moment as i do see some parts involved with transactions being created but i don t see any signs of any transactions being used whatsoever edit additional information as requested by jb nizet my entire application is annotation driven and so my service beans are annotated with service and injected into my controllers via name based autowiring the below

i have a simple server written in java that supplies my client apps with data from an access database accdb the data comes from a query in the database that combines data from multiple worksheets in a linked excel workbook xlsx this wasn t working out since the excel workbook needed to be updated regularly by the owner and the database needed constant uptime and excel locks the file when the database is open so to circumvent the problem i changed the database to run off of a copy of the workbook i wrote a batch script which kills the java server thus closing the connection to the database and unlocking the copied excel workbook it would then copy over the contents of the original to the copied file location and restart the server thus updating the data in the database i set windows task scheduler to run this batch file every day sloppy solution but it worked or so i thought the batch file only ran once and hasn t run since then so before i go throw another bandaid on this i figured i d ask here is there a way to setup the original excel workbook to close all connections when a specific user needs to access the file if i can do that all i ll have to do is make my server attempt to reconnect after a disconnect which shouldn t be hard 	java

new to stackoverflow and relatively new to javascript jquery i ve been trying to develop a website that contains a vector map using the raphael plugin and when a particular area of the map is clicked i want it to open a lightbox using the colorbox plugin i have the raphael and colorbox plugins working individually i ve got the hover function working for raphael and i ve got the colorbox to work when a normal link is clicked however i m not sure how to get the colorbox to work when it is a raphael element that is clicked this is because i think i need to add the inline class to the raphael element however my click function can only get a url i can t add a class apologies if this question doesn t make much sense i ve been going round in circles for hours now current click function locs is an array of the raphael objects in a separate document locarr is an array containing these objects for a for loop id and url are elements of the raphael object click function location href locs locarr this id url the colorbox works with a normal link like below but i can t figure out a way to add the class to my click function i ve tried various versions of addclass and similar with no success lt a href link class inline gt link lt a gt i think my problem is because the raphael objects do not exist in the html the url is taken straight from the javascript document sorry again if this doesn t make sense thanks 	javascript jquery

title might be a bit confusing i ll try my best to explain what i need to achieve basically i have the following elements to a particular webpage header always visible above content content background image covers the entire content area this is the key part sub footer information about the content always visible below it footer standard company footer visible if window height is a certain size otherwise need to scroll down to see it as i mention above the content portion of the page is maybe the trickiest part i need a big image to be in the background that covers the entire area css tricks has an excellent guide in the ways to do full page background images so i m hoping this can be achieved easily the issue is how to make the sub footer stay at the bottom if the window is lt 720px with the footer underneath it below the fold needing you to scroll to it a window 720px should show both the sub footer and the footer with no scrollbars i won t even worry at this point about a minimum height the content needs to be possibly necessitating scrollbars on the content lt div gt or making both the sub footer and footer go below the fold here are image mockups of what i m trying to achieve first a window lt 720px tall where the footer needs to be scrolled to second a window lt 720px tall that has been scrolled down to see the footer finally a tall window 720px that has no scrollbars because everything is visible i m using jquery and don t care about ie6 can i achieve this in css do i have to use jquery to dynamically adjust things full page backgrounds are easily done with css3 i m happy to use css3 or html5 to do what i need 	jquery html
this is a small application used on a company intranet by 4 people at the most and i am new to c and net so the solution does not have to be grandiose i am trying to create a search field for simple net c r u d app where the user can pick a category they wish to search from such as application name or manager and then a text box where they can filter the results based on that field name the items in the drop down menu are the class field members and i would like for all of them to be searchable i m using the dynamic linq library to create a string so that i can pass the column name at run time but for some reason my queries return no results here is my current query dr_details dr_details where 0 1 searchtype searchstring so for instance searchtype amp searchstring get their values from the query string we ll say manager and joe respectively so that the query should be substituted as dr_details dr_details where manager joe this gives me no results however if i hard code the string manager joe into the query runs fine any suggestions this problem would make me yank out my hair if it was long enough p 	c#

how do i create a character array using decimal hexadecimal representation of characters instead of actual characters reason i ask is because i am writing c code and i need to create a string that includes characters that are not used in english language that string would then be parsed and displayed to an lcd screen for example 0 decodes to 0 and n to 10 are there any more of these special characters that i can sacrifice to display custom characters i could send temperature is 10 d c and degree sign is printed instead of d something like this would be great 	c++

i m not optimistic about getting an answer to this one since it s such a weird and seemingly machine specific issue but i m posting in the hopes that someone else has figured this one out i m developing an application in c using visual studio and the mysql data ado net driver version 6 9 8 for database access twice i ve run into a situation where very simple sql queries that worked only moments before start timing out from that point forward they never succeed again but only on my machine every other query in the application and there are hundreds works fine but the one query even if i change it slightly never works again if i push the code and another developer runs it the code works perfectly on his machine as an example of how simple these queries are here s the one i m most recently having issues with select from user_preferences where user_id user_id limit 1 the table i m selecting from has only 1 row and 4 columns it couldn t be simpler while the query is waiting to time out it does not appear in the process list for mysql so i have to assume that either it never made it to the server or the server returned instantly and the mysql connector is just failing to return the response i d like to figure out which but i doubt it would make a difference either way so to summarize that query worked fine this morning i changed nothing except some unrelated code and it briefly started returning no data i started debugging it and now it just times out another developer runs the code and it works perfectly i m at a complete loss here short of figuring this out i fear i m going to have to re image my laptop and i d really like to avoid that if at all possible any help would be appreciated though like i said it s probably quite a shot in the dark edit the c code in question using var connection new mysqlconnection connectionsettings getconnectionstring await connection openasync cancellationtoken using var reader await mysqlhelper executereaderasync connection sql query tostring cancellationtoken sql parameters toarray while await reader readasync cancellationtoken readeraction reader 	c#

i ve noticed that with projects i have created recently there comes a new approach to proguard which is to use a pre built script sdk dir tools proguard proguard android txt this is without optimisation and comes with a comment optimization is turned off by default dex does not like code run through the proguard optimize and preverify steps and performs some of these optimizations on its own it appears that following this advice means that assumenosideeffects has no effect for example these common tasks remove logging assumenosideeffects class android util log public static boolean isloggable java lang string int public static int v public static int i public static int w public static int d public static int e remove asserts assumenosideeffects class junit framework assert public static assert proof it s not working if release assert asserttrue proguard config error asserts have been left in false is there a safe middle ground where i can apply optimisation to trim out debug as defined with assumenosideeffects but without risking the associated problems with dex and proguard optimisation 	android

i want to build a simple banner image slider functionality but instead of sliding the images are supposed to fade in and out it s a drupal project so i don t know how many images are going to be used the structure is simple enough lt div class banner container gt lt potentially a lot of divs with background images gt lt div gt what i want to do is essentially iterate through this array of divs let the currently active one fade out and let the one that the array is pointing to at the moment fade in i thought i could get it to work like this var a banner container children while 1 a each function active fadeout 500 removeclass active this fadein 500 addclass active obviously there is a lot wrong in my code i have run into multiple issues but the one i cannot seem to solve is getting the loop to wait between the iterations to my knowledge a traditional loop like foreach could just have some sort of wait function added to the end of it and execute that wait in every loop but the each seems to execute every iteration simultaneously how can i loop through an array like this potentially infinitely and wait like 5 seconds every time i read somewhere that the animate functions work asynchronously and i assume the same goes for css transforms so creating fadein and fadeout classes and try this with css wouldn t work 	javascript jquery

i m trying to design a map using images that overlap in an isometric format right now i have 2 different designs each one fixes the other s issue here is the current setup http mc1 empirebattles com map maplayout html the display on the left has issues with the vertical overlap and the display on the right has issues with the horizontal overlap i know that the reason is due to the fact that when a z index is applied to the parent container the subsequent z indexes applied to the children is localized inside the parent but i still need the row effect to span across the multiple parent divs i know one solution is to just not assign a z index to the parent divs and just assign ascending descending z indexes to each row but in the final product the parent divs will be created dynamically and i m trying to avoid having to do calculations at each row for relative z index i cant think of any other way to do it though anyone else have any ideas on how to apply z index relatively 	javascript jquery html

my app s simplified structure is this uitabbarcontroller with one uinavigationcontroller holding a uitableviewcontroller as root view controller when tapping one of the table view controller cells i push a regular uiviewcontroller lets call it vc end hiding the bottom tab bar using the hide bottom bar when pushed flag in storyboard i added a regular uiview subclass to vc that look like a bottom bar and i use auto layout to pin it to the bottom of the vc view the problem when i push vc it takes a second for this view to pin to the bottom it looks like auto layout pin it to the bottom as if the tab bar is not hidden and after a sec it recognise that the tab bar is hidden and moves it to the real bottom of the view i know its not the best explanation so i added a very simple project to demonstrate the issue 	ios

i am using the boost python library to wrap a c++ class i have so that i can call its methods from python my c++ class clazz has public methods void dosomething std string amp s void dosomethingwide std wstring amp ws i ve created a boost_python_module which points to these two methods the first one which uses std string i m able to call fine however when i try to call the second one with a python unicode string x u hello clazz dosomethingwide x i get the error argumenterror python argument types in clazz dosomethingwide clazz unicode did not match c++ signature dosomething clazz std wstring i had hoped that unicode would automatically interface with std wstring as the regular python string type did with std string however this appears to not be the case in another thread someone suggested first doing the conversion x str x encode utf 8 however i am dealing with very large strings and this destroys the performance of my code since it is o n in the number of characters of x i do have the ability to modify the c++ library that i m trying to interface with is there a way to pass in python unicode types into my c++ library in a way that i can use them i ve searched the internet far and wide and found some references to converters and other things but implementing them did not fix the above error message very possibly i m not using them correctly 	c++ python
from here the async keyword enables the await keyword in that method and changes how method results are handled that s all the async keyword does the second part got me interesting but i didn t find explanation to this in the article doing a little test notice no awaited tasks are here static void x try y catch exception ex console writeline ex message static async void y lt notice here throw new notimplementedexception static void main string args x console readline this will terminate the program while removing async from this static async void y throw new notimplementedexception will yield msdn says nothing about it if the method that the async keyword modifies doesn t contain an await expression or statement the method executes synchronously a compiler warning alerts you to any async methods that don t contain await because that situation might indicate an error question if so what else does the word async does that my code yields different results 	c#

so the past day something strange is happening with my admob ads first you should know that we usually know when someone is using our android app because it sends their score to our server right after they are finished so no one appears to be using it and all of a sudden the requests keep going up and up without any clicks desperate to save my relatively high click through rate ctr i disable refresh hoping that it was just someone who left their phone on and the screen was not sleeping this however did nothing and the requests keep coming in at the writing of this has anyone experienced something similar i am thinking it is maybe a glitch or maybe admob purposely screwing up my ctr everything was fine for the past 2 weeks until now update it stopped after about 8 hours of continuous ad requests and impressions the cause is still unknown but my ctr has suffered because of it and is now below 1 percent hopefully this doesn t happen again 	android

is there a way to specify the port for a httpcookie i have a site that is available at sub example com and needs to be deployed at sub example com 81 and sub example com 82 so the same domain different ports using apache2 and mono the authentication is done by using cookies specifying the domain and path sub example com domain sub example com path sub example com 81 domain sub example com 81 path sub example com 82 domain sub example com 82 path seems that the port in domain is not used all works fine for sub example com but when logged on sub example com the page at sub example com 81 also receives the authentication cookie set by sub example com so i want to be able to specify also the port to a httpcookie to restricts the ports to which this cookie may be sent or maybe there is a workaround to simulate this 	c#
i ve been meaning to implement a data grid into my website where users can dynamically add and edit product information i have tried jeasyui see links below however it does not incorporate a date time picker gui within the field i need this because some of the fields that the user has to input includes the shipping date and expiry and manually writing out the date and time could be cumbersome http www jeasyui com tutorial datagrid datagrid12_demo html http jeasyui com demo main index php i have used the jeasyui library and it seems to have worked so far in terms of the data grid but before i start to write extra code for this i am looking to get some insight on ways to approach incorporating a date time picker that checks for date overlaps i have tried incorporating jquery datepicker as a field in the grid but it was unsuccessful i am not tied to the jeasyui library so if you any other libraries you have used that accomplishes this that would be really helpful i currently use php for my server side scripting tied in with a mysql database and jquery for my client side scripting would really appreciate your answers thanks in advance peter 	javascript php jquery

so i have a big huge dataset that i m plotting on an html5 canvas so plotting it takes about 3 seconds so in those three seconds i need to show a loading bar to communicate to the user that things are happening basically in this time i m drawing to an offscreen canvas that is used as a cache for the duration of the use of my app i d like to update a loading bar while this is happening but for some reason jquery is ignoring my calls to resize the loading bar until after the drawing has completed and at that point the loading bar is sort of useless as it just jumps to 100 so here s the gist of what i m trying to do function drawstuff for p in points points p draw updateloadingbar p points length function updateloadingbar percent loading_bar width percent+ this code is a little simplistic no it s not actually getting the dom element in the loop but this is more concise and has the same result the important thing is that the whole browser locks up and nothing happens in any other language you d just start up a worker thread to do this but that s not an option here so i m wondering what the best approach to keeping a responsive ui while doing a lot of work is thanks 	jquery

sencha touch seems like an amazing way to develop mobile apps i ve seen posts by people incorporating jquery d3 at the same time the posts describing customizing controls seems to be fairly narrow adding the picture of a kitten next to the slider and labeling the slider seems kinda tame compared to what ios can do in terms of custom controls at least in terms of examples available most blog posts imply you can extend the control objects in sencha or the css file these posts are not quite what i m looking for that s my problem i can t see any examples of anyone changing default controls in sencha touch but they make it sound as if it might be possible to do anything this is my question is sencha touch able to build an ios or android app incorporating any javascript library or html5 are there any limitations here to give an example i trying to implement a custom slider where a touch along a continuous line or a circle like this color selector will enter new values further if you incorporate a library like protovis or d3 or raphael charts can sencha display anything the graph canvas element will otherwise display will it take touch input and interact with the graph libraries the way that the html5 graph does 	javascript
all this seems like a simple problem but it s giving me fits lets say i have a c++ base class called animal and derived classes cat dog horse hippo snake i have another class called zoo that contains a list qt list in this case where the base class animal is a qobject of animal objects now what i want to do is create a zoo object and be able to copy it to another zoo object and have the destination zoo have it s own copy of the animals the problem is in the zoo copy constructor because it thinks it has a list of animals it calls the copy constructor for animal instead of dog cat etc as compilers are ought to do to get around this i changed the animal list to be a list of animal pointers and then created my own animal copy constructor and assignment operator each of these calls the animal clone animal amp rhs method that in turn calls each derived class of animals clone method that returns a new pointer allocated from the heap with a copy of its data this all works fine but i keep thinking that i m missing a more elegant solution so my question is when you have a container with objects of a type how do we copy the class that contains the container i hope that makes sense 	c++

i have an app that uses some code scripts to generate dll s at run time and invoke them as needed and have run into some questions before i go ahead and code it is it possible to unload them from memory when not needed if not what would be the performance impact of loading them into separate appdomains and invoking the calls using some ipc etc btw this needs to be highly performant real time alternatively how about loading multiple instances of the generated assembly with different version s of course i d assume if you release all references not being used it might be unloaded by the gc framework also a q would there be any collisions not sure if this is the right word in this scenario 	c#

i have to parse several comma separated files containing headers via a generic parser the headers come in great number and i need to provide the ability to choose the few headers that matter the concrete parsers that implement my generic one for each file type have to override an online idictionary string string line method among others this line maps header value to corresponding data in the line my problem i use a comma separated list in my app config at the moment the problem of that is that my concrete parsers will have to use actual header values as keys i d like to be able to introduce constants so that no rebuild is necessary in case a header changes at the moment my app config looks like this lt configsections gt lt section name headers type system configuration namevaluesectionhandler gt lt configsections gt lt headers gt lt add key file1 value actualheader1 actualheader2 actualheader3 gt lt add key file2 value actualheader4 actualheader5 actualheader6 gt lt add key file3 value actualheader7 actualheader8 actualheader9 gt lt headers gt i would need something like no requirements in terms of what is tag key value just trying to show the logic i am after lt configsections gt lt section name headers type gt lt configsections gt lt headers gt lt file1 gt lt add key headerconstant1 value actualheader1 gt lt add key headerconstant2 value actualheader2 gt lt add key headerconstant3 value actualheader3 gt lt file1 gt lt file2 gt lt add key headerconstant4 value actualheader4 gt lt add key headerconstant5 value actualheader5 gt lt add key headerconstant6 value actualheader6 gt lt file2 gt lt file3 gt lt add key headerconstant7 value actualheader7 gt lt add key headerconstant8 value actualheader8 gt lt add key headerconstant9 value actualheader9 gt lt file3 gt lt headers gt the second option would enable changes in the actual header value to find in files without impacting the code how can i do this i there any quickfix already implemented 	c#
i m having an issue with an array i wish to put 2 elements into my array together in the same element within the array but keep the default index currently i have this in my array array 0 gt 2 1 gt mongoid object id gt 57b99696ce2350100b000029 2 gt 1 3 gt mongoid object id gt 57b998ccce2350181700002b 4 gt 1 5 gt mongoid object id gt 57b99a84ce2350100b00002b and i wish to have something like this i think array 0 gt number gt 2 mongoid object id gt 57b99696ce2350100b000029 1 gt number gt 1 mongoid object id gt 57b998ccce2350181700002b 2 gt number gt 1 mongoid object id gt 57b99a84ce2350100b00002b i wish to retain the default key as well as have two other values i have tried a few methods but none resulted in the elements being paired together as i want currently above i tried array array_merge array array number doc _id i also tried array array_merge array array number gt doc _id and array_push array doc _id number asked here on so earlier but this adds onto the end of an array both elements rather than adding both together into a single element can anyone advise the correct way to add two elements as a pair together whilst maintaining the default key index value of the array 	php

the following code fails to compile with two errors on the line func amp pobj stating cannot convert x to const x in function main and type mismatch in parameter 1 wanted const x got x in function main even though its the correct way to pass pointer parameters and also on commenting this particular line i e func amp pobj and uncommenting the two lines above it which declares a new const pointer pp of required type in parameter of func but still throws an error on the line which declares and assigns pp saying cannot convert x to const x in function main using x int void func const x int main x pobj new x 58 const x pp amp pobj error func pp func amp pobj error i believe that this is the correct way to pass constant pointers as parameters and i just don t understand why the program fails to compile can anyone point out the fault in the code above and suggest me the correct logic syntax if i am wrong thanks in advance update this question was marked as duplicate but it doesn t have the answer that solves the problem at hand thus i would love it if the stack overflow community would help me to solve my problem here thanks 	c++
my project consists on creating a freecell game using html 5 canvas and javascript i currently have a partially working game but the code started getting very messy thus i started refactoring it and i identified some behavior that i could centralize in objects i have an interface called cardcontainer which holds cards in the game and the classes which implement it are freecell homecell and stack which are the temporary cell the stack where i put the cards out of the game and the initial stacks where i work with the cards during the game respectively two relevant methods on this interface are push cards card for stack it has one or more cards inside and for the others it has only one card pop quantity integer card for stack it returns the quantity amount of cards but for the others it returns always one i see that my design is wrong here because some of the clients of my interface will simply ignore the quantity parameter on the pop method on the other hand if i change this interface for something more consistent e g with or without parameter depending on the client i will introduce a code smell of downcasting where i would be always checking the type of the client here first of all i don t know how do i formulate this question in more generic terms how can i fix this design to at the same time get rid of the parameter for unnecessary clients and avoid downcasting edit i have a move method which receives a source and destination which share the interface cardcontainer 	javascript

i have two static libraries and one macos app all under latest xcode 8 1 1 first lib a is objc++ mixed objc and c++ stl 2 second b is pure objc and contains some common categories for nsobject for example 3 the app is swift and use both libs all targets builds with the same c++ flags libc++11 and so on the problem is 1 if i add objc and or load_all linker flags to the app to normal linkage with lib b categories then i got many undefined symbols for architecture x86_64 all about stl 2 if i remove this linker flags then app compile normal but in runtime i v got missing selector for all lib b categories however if i completely remove lib b adding all of its sources directly in the app and respectively remove objc load_all then the problem with the stl linking is solved but unfortunately this is not the right option for me so i hope for your help or at least an explanation of thanks 	c++

i have a number of java classes that use private sets or lists internally i want to be able to return these sets lists using a get list method the alternatives i am considering return a reference to the internal object construct a new set list and fill it up this seems bad practice use collections unmodifiablelist partitions which of these is the most common best way to solve this issue 	java

i m working on estimating distance from stereo cameras i am using python 2 7 11 and opencv 3 1 versions i calibrated every camera separately and found intrinsic parameters the problem is that when i use cv2 stereocalibtare function in the way stated in opencv documents i get the error typeerror cameramatrix1 is not a numerical tuple the code looks like this stereo_criteria cv2 term_criteria_max_iter + cv2 term_criteria_eps 100 1e 5 ret_stereo r t e f cv2 stereocalibrate objpointsl imgpointsl imgpointsr grayl shape 1 mtxl distcoeffl mtxr distcoeffr criteria stereo_criteria flags cv2 calib_fix_intrinsic i thought that changing the camera matrix into tuple using tuple function might work it didn t change anything and then i thought the problem might be the version of opencv that i m using so i changed it into 2 4 13 but that didn t change anything also after all these tries i thought i let the stereocalibrate do the camera matrix and distortion coefficient estimation itself without any single camera calibration the code looked like this stereo_criteria cv2 term_criteria_max_iter + cv2 term_criteria_eps 100 1e 5 stereocalib_retval cameramatrix1 distcoeffs1 cameramatrix2 distcoeffs2 r t e f cv2 stereocalibrate objpointsl imgpointsl imgpointsr grayl shape criteria stereo_criteria but it gets an error saying typeerror required argument distcoeffs1 pos 5 not found i just can t figure out why this function is not working all i want is to calculate the r t e f values update for the last error i tried this stereocalib_retval cameramatrix1 distcoeffs1 cameramatrix2 distcoeffs2 r t e f cv2 stereocalibrate objpointsl imgpointsl imgpointsr mtxl distcoeffl mtxr distcoeffr image_size criteria stereocalib_criteria flags stereocalib_flags and it worked although putting cameramatrix1 distcoeffs1 cameramatrix2 distcoeffs2 were not needed and are actually equal to mtxl discoeffl mtxr discoeffr respectively omitting them was causing error for me the first problem still remains i appreciate your help masood saber 	python
disclaimer i know an answer to this question i thought it might be of some general interest question how can we have a type trait that produces the type that results from performing default argument promotions motivation i would like to be able to use variable arguments portably for example void foo char const fmt please pass unsigned short bool char32_t unsigned char when passing arguments to a function call without parameters i e matching the ellipsis the arguments undergo default argument promotion so far so good but those promotions are platform dependent i can recover the arguments with va_arg ap t but what is t now for some simple situations this is easy for example i can always say unsigned short n va_args ap unsigned int the default promotion will result in either a signed int or an unsigned int but according to say c11 7 16 1 1 3 va casting to unsigned int is always fine since even if the default promotion results in an int the original value can be represented by both types but what type should i cast to when i expect a char32_t c++11 4 5 2 leaves the resulting type wide open so i would like a trait that lets me write char32_t c va_args ap default_promote lt char32_t gt type how to do this bonus points for a trait that produces a static assertion when the parameter type must not be passed as a variable argument 	c++
i am trying to setup a list of items in wpf which contains strings of random length people s names the majority of them are generally within a certain size but occasionally you come across a string so long that it runs out of the bounds of it s container i ve normally just truncated it when it s too long but i would much rather show the entirety of the string how can i force the text to remain it s normal size unless too big to fit in which case scale it down to fit note this is not the same as scaling all text to fit a certain size which is accomplished using a viewbox around the text ie this is not what i want lt viewbox maxwidth 100 gt lt textblock text binding employeedisplayname updatesourcetrigger propertychanged horizontalalignment left verticalalignment center gt lt viewbox gt this makes everything scale up when too small as well as scale down when too big i only want it to scale down when too big and never scale up when too small any thoughts 	c#
please could you explain why given the following boost regex pattern boost regex re s+ w index html is a match and index html is not regexbuddy in perl mode finds a match in both cases could you suggest a pattern that would work thanks p s the w at the end is needed in order to ignore the punctuation on the end of an url like index html upd sorry just tried to make a simple test program and it works there i guess the problem might be in the code that calls regex_search i need a bit more time to find this out upd2 indeed the problem was in my code please vote to close the question sorry for not researching enough before posting 	c++

i cannot open an ssrs report rendered as an xlsx file produced by calling the reporting services web service reportexecution2005 asmx wsdl from an ssis script task but i can open xls files produced by

can t be opened and produces the following error excel cannot open the file because the file format or file extension is not valid verify that the file in my code i m using mimetype application vnd ms

so this is the sort of thing i m looking to accomplish class class object _map 0 classdefault 1 3 2 xyz def handle_map self print join self _map 0 self _map 1 self _map 2 class subclass class _map 3 012 class subsubclass subclass _map 0 subclassdefault 4 mno def handle_map self print join self _map 0 self map 4 upper super handle_map c sc ssc class subclass subsubclass c handle_map classdefault 3 xyz sc handle_map classdefault 3 xyz _map 3 is used by some other method entirely etc ssc handle_map subsubclassdefault mno 3 xyz or subsubclassdefault 3 xyz so essentially what i want to do is have an easy way to define values in a parent and it s subclasses i want that data to be handled by default at the level in the hierarchy that defined it because subclasses shouldn t have to but i also want the subclasses to have the option of either overriding that handling altogether or at least modifying it before it goes up the chain i m not completely hung up on _map being a dictionary it could be a set of objects or even just tuples etc the clearest example i can give for a use case would be to generate signatures for init so many but not all of the parameters would be common and i want to avoid using the same boiler plate over and over again at the same time sensible defaults for the parent class are not sensible for the subclasses they should be able to override those defaults likewise a subclass might have a different way it needs to interpret a given value or not so it shouldn t be obligated to entirely redefine how it handles them if only some slight modification is necessary i ve got some half formed ideas of how this could or should be implemented but nothing has come all the way together yet i got quite long way into implementing a metaclass to do this but had difficulty getting the parent classes methods to ignore the values defined handled by subclasses as i typed this up i considered using collections chainmap to replace a bunch of the code i wrote in the metaclass but that doesn t yet solve any of the problems i ve ran into i think so my question is what is the most sensible existing pattern for this alternatively is this simply not a feasible thing to ask for 	python

i want to write an asynchronous timer that calls a function after a certain amount of time has passed now i want to be able to bind a function using boost bind with any signature that the timer calls after a certain interval has passed the way i do it right now is inspired by boost thread which has sort of an abstract baseclass to store the threaded function this is what i do class timedfunctionbase public virtual void call 0 typedef std shared_ptr lt timedfunctionbase gt timedfunctionbaseptr template lt class f gt class timedfunction public timedfunctionbase public timedfunction f _f m_function _f void call m_function private f m_function then inside the timer function i simply save the callback as follows myasynctimer private timedfunctionbaseptr m_callback and call it inside the timed function with m_callback gt call my question is actually pretty simple does boost already provide a mechanism to do this after a long search i could not really find much and the internals of boost thread also looked as if there is nothing predefined for this kind of use maybe boost function_base the docs say that you may not create it directly is there a boost way or do i have to write these container classes myself 	c++

so just as a back story to what i ve done so far and what i want to achieve currently i m using a whole heap of singleton classes to pass my instances around which is going to become a very bad idea very soon as i m looking into multithreading and have heard more like read that singletons can become evil and a huge problem when multithreading is involved in my main init class i ve got code that initialises an window renderer and a surface sdl2 i m wanting to break the code down so that i ve got a class that handles only the window code same with the renderer and surface too i m looking for ways if they re possible to make an instance of a variable which will hold say the primary window and then be able to access said variable without using a dedicated function e g in the init function of window bool window init m_primarywindow sdl_createwindow creation info here if m_primarywindow sdl_loginfo info primary window created return true else sdl_logcritical critical could not create primary window n s sdl_geterror return false as you can see normal right well say i create a window class in game i d have to add a function such as sdl_window primarywindow window getprimarywindow to get that instance but that s not what i want i want to create only one sdl_window variable in window and reference to that in a function that uses a string maybe eg sdl_window window getwindow std string id so that in game i could just init and show the window and then call the instance like window m_window m_window getwindow primarywindow so that i can use that instead of constantly creating sdl_window variables all over my code same needs to be done with the renderer too edit ok so i ve made the following changes and it works but i can t access the values within the mapped structure window hpp typedef struct sdl_window window const char title int width int height int flags m_windowstruct typedef std map lt std string m_windowstruct gt m_windowmap window cpp bool window init if createwindow window creation variables here return true else return false bool window createwindow std string id const char title int width int height int flags m_windowmap windowmap m_windowstruct windowdata windowdata window sdl_createwindow title sdl_windowpos_centered sdl_windowpos_centered width height flags if windowdata window windowdata title tile windowdata width width windowdata height height windowdata flags flags windowmap gt insert m_windowmap value_type id amp windowdata sdl_loginfo info window creation successful return true else return false so i guess my question now is how would i grab the window pointer from the struct within the map also as a side note how would i then destroy the pointer once i m finished 	c++

good afternoon in my timezone i want to compare two dates one of them is inserted by the user and the other is the present day snippet of code var datestring 2012 01 03 var date new date datestring date lt new date true false this returns true i think under the hood both date objects are transformed to milliseconds and then compared and if it is this way the today object is bigger because of the hours and minutes so what i want to do is compare dates just by the day month and year what is the best approach create a new date object and then reset the hours minutes and milliseconds to zero before the comparison or extract the day the month and year from both dates object and make the comparison is there any better approach thanks in advance with the best regards happy new year 	javascript

i would like to know what would be the best design or the overall view for a webapp project about a multiplayer chess game using django on the server side and jquery on the client side the project has the following assumptions premises no chess specific rules it will be just a game board with free moving pieces no turn tracking or anything related users are free to play arround with pieces over the game board real time multiplay any changes made by one player e g move a piece are automatically rendered on the oposite player window session saving users can stop a game session and resume it later drag amp drop pieces pieces occupy defined places over the game board grid and cannot be stacked like the original game the django part doesn t seems too difficult at a first sight it is the jquery part probably jquery ui that intrigues me though i was thinking about using django to store all the information about the game piece s position etc while leaving jquery to act like a constructor based on the game model stored in django sorry for the information overload but i really have no idea of what i m going to need to do to finish a project like this thanks in advance 	jquery

after writing the client i m trying to write a server using an asynchronous socket i found the server implementation here i start the server and it will wait for the connection to come in on the gui side i will have a button that will connect my server to the client if there is no client i want an error message shown on the gui and it will wait for another button click and if there is a client i need both of them to show connected in the gui and start working is it possible 	c#
i have a tableview with values that could be the same when selecting the cell the textfield value will be populated with the selected cell i want to only highlight the row that was selected rather than highlight all the values that are the same as the textfield my approach currently where data is an array of possible values if cell nil cell uitableviewcell alloc initwithstyle uitableviewcellstyledefault reuseidentifier identifiercell nsstring value self data objectatindex indexpath row nsstring selectedvalue textfield text if value floatvalue selectedvalue floatvalue cell backgroundcolor uicolor colorwithred 220 0 255 0 green 220 0 255 0 blue 220 0 255 0 alpha 1 0 cell textlabel textcolor uicolor whitecolor else cell backgroundcolor uicolor clearcolor cell textlabel textcolor uicolor blackcolor side note i have a couple of these drop down fields that can change the textfield text depending on which row was selected i e if row 1 was selected in the other dropdown then 1 391 would be populated in the textfield text not sure how relevant that will be how would i check only the row that was selected and populate the textfield per the image below update thanks to k06a using indexpath is a step forward however the problem now arises where when if row a is selected the indexpath for b should not change i was thinking of setting 2 different indexpath variables and on didselectrowat only set those for the methods i m calling to change the other respective values 	ios

i am attempting to implement a cloth simulation using a spring particle system but something isn t quite right with my physics when i run the simulation the cloth draws as expected but over time the force of gravity pulls the cloth downward indefinitely in other words the forces caused by the springs are not accumulating properly to overcome the downward pull of gravity and i end up with this it continues to droop downwards indefinitely from all of the debugging i have done what i have seen is that the accumulation of forces on a particle caused by all of the springs attached to it is not properly summing when the force of gravity causes increased stretch i can not figure out what i have overlooked in my physics my cloth updates every time step using this function void cloth

i ve inheirited support for a legacy web app which is directly using the internal apache xerces classes within the rt jar i think the history is that this code back in java1 4 used to explicitly use xerces and at some point when moving to java5 use of the xerces jar was dropped and those classes were referenced out of rt jar as the internal equivalents i m trying to understand what the impact of running this project on various web containers will be e g websphere versus tomcat etc is rt jar supplied by sun or the jvm jre vendor do alternate vendors continue to use xerces internally or are there other xml implementations at some point resource permitting this code will need to be changed to use the standard java apis i was want to get a handle on how big a problem this might be thanks rob 	java

description i am creating a simulator for different resolutions basically i have a control inside a panel then the user can choose an aspect ratio more information below and the control inside the simulator should get resized to match the desired ratio problem the problem is that i do not know what is a good way to calculate the size of the control without having to use a lot of cpu or trying or resizing how can i know if i have to resize the height or the width of the control to fit inside the simulator the simulator can grow or shrink that is why i can not be sure if the control inside of it will fill up the whole width of the simulator or the height but the aspect ratio should be always correct hint this is probably a very easy mathematical problem i just don t find a solution right now today is not my day if you have any ideas or suggestions feel free to ask and propose example available resolutions 3 2 like on the iphone until iphone 5 anyone knows an other name 16 10 wxga 16 9 widescreen 4 3 vga thanks for helping 	c#

i know there a lot of questions and answers of this already but unfortunately i think my situation may be unique for some reason the time change seems to be making the day calculate as one day less than it should be calculating here is my php that i was using and it was working great until it started to overlap a start and end date that was before daylight savings and after daylight savings respectively fyi this is a recent issue since daylight savings time starts this weekend lastdate and firstdate are 2 unix timestamps with valid month day and year values the times are irrelevant at this point they are only meant to represent a day i start by making sure these have the same time values lastdate mktime 23 59 59 date m lastdate date j lastdate date y lastdate firstdate mktime 23 59 59 date m firstdate date j firstdate date y firstdate then calculate the total number of days in between totaldays abs floor firstdate lastdate 60 60 24 so again to be clear the above works if i m not overlapping the daylight savings time change for reference how to find the dates between two specified date actual days between two unix timestamps in php finding days between 2 unix timestamps in php and i m still on php 5 2 right now edit update i ve found the following on this links how to find the dates between two specified date and how to calculate the the interval between 2 unix timestamps in php without dividing by 86400 60 60 24 lastdate and firstdate are 2 unix timestamps with valid month day and year values the times are irrelevant at this point they are only meant to represent a day i start by making sure these have the same time values lastdate mktime 10 00 00 date m lastdate date j lastdate date y lastdate firstdate mktime 10 00 00 date m firstdate date j firstdate date y firstdate then calculate the total number of days in between totaldays floor firstdate 86400 floor lastdate 86400 and it seems to work right now for the crossover of dst anyone see any issues with this 	php

i have a list of ids i m trying to manipulate in order to get long strings of the following format id1 id2 id3 idn that is a long string where the ids are separated by commas which are also a part of the string here s the catch each of these long strings can be no more than 1 000 characters in length total and since i want the code to work on any list i feed it i can t say in advance how many strings of length 1 000 the raw list of ids will require so ideally i d like to have a script that takes that list of ids and generates variables of the following form str1 string of the first 1000 chars str2 string of the next 1000 chars srt3 string of the next 1000 chars and so on how do i do that how do i generate variables on the go by need i thought about maybe generating one long string at the first stage like long_str for item in my_list long_str + str item + def find_num_segments x if x 1000 0 return x 1000 else return x 1000 + 1 notice that if x lt 1000 then x 1000 0 actually x so it will fall under else x lt 1000 1000 gives 0 so the function yields 0+1 num_segments find_num_segments long_str for i in range num_segments starting_position 0 print str d i num_segments starting_position starting_position+1000 starting_position + 1000 but that s ugly and probably unpythonic doesn t produce clean results as there are formatting leftovers such as the brackets and quotes 014300070358ful 014300031032uni doesn t actually work i get a typeerror not all arguments converted during string formatting on the 1st line of find_num_segments edit i realize that won t produce the correct outcome either as there s no guarantee an id won t be cut in the middle how would you create a function that concatenates the ids one by one and stops before getting to the 1000 chars mark if the next id won t fit all the way in then starts a new batch of 1000 chars here s a sample list if anybody wants to help and needs one help would be appreciated thanks 	python

this is kind of a beginners question but i haven t done c++ in a long time so here goes i have a class that contains a dynamically allocated array say class a int myarray a myarray 0 a int size myarray new int size a note that as per mikeb s helpful style critique no need to check against 0 delete myarray but now i want to create a dynamically allocated array of these classes here s my current code a arrayofas new a 5 for int i 0 i lt 5 ++i arrayofas i a 3 but this blows up terribly because the new a object created with the a 3 call gets destructed when the for loop iteration finishes and this means that the internal myarray of that a instance gets delete ed so i think my syntax must be terribly wrong i guess there are a few fixes that seem like overkill which i m hoping to avoid creating a copy constructor for a using vector lt int gt and vector lt a gt so i don t have to worry about all this instead of having arrayofas be an array of a objects have it be an array of a pointers i would think this is just some beginners thing where there s a syntax that actually works when attempting to dynamically allocate an array of things that have internal dynamic allocation also style critiques appreciated since it s been a while since i did c++ update for future viewers all of the answers below are really helpful martin s is accepted because of the example code and the useful rule of 4 but i really suggest reading them all some are good succinct statements of what s wrong and some point out correctly how and why vector s are a good way to go 	c++

i am experiencing what seems to be a traditional problem for node js beginners and async requests i have an unknown number of urls generate by the user and subsequently stored in an array on my node js server the node js server must iterate through these urls making a request to each one in turn it must do so in order and it must wait for each response before moving onto the next url when a new request will be made the final result should be the in order collection of all the responses which happen to be json nicely stored together as a json object which in turn can be sent back to the client when ready i think i should use the async nodejs library and i am already using needle for making the requests urls http a http s http d async eachseries urls function url callback i m not clear how to use async to ensure that the needle request has finished and store that response accordingly before moving onto the next url request below is an example of my needle request needle get url options function error response body either a partial or complete solution to the whole problem is welcome 	javascript

i m working with an existing schema about combat data in a video game because i have to work with data generated by an external program this schema isn t technically compatible with how i want to organize the data but it mostly works one problem that comes up 3 times so far is providing the user with a big table of data to browse search through to start sifting through the data that s available so i decided to have a single generic way of generating a data table and handling ajax requests for more data to that table the problem is that one of these cases is basically retrieving data straight from a table while another is actually retrieving summarized data from a table for example the schema defines a combatant or a participant in a combat but i want the system to expose a concept of a character or a thing that exists and participates in many combats so a character would be a combatant in multiple different encounter s there s basically two ways i can create the idea of a character from the database i can either use a view or i can have my orm sqlalchemy create the required query from scratch every time view support is possible in sqlalchemy via some possible extensions but because i m summarizing i lose the primary key and therefore i can t create an orm class representing the view supposedly you can force a column to be a primary key but that didn t work for me seemed to do nothing if i try to use the query from scratch my current way of generating a generic table doesn t work for want of being able to inspect a query result so i have two questions and a mcve for the query from scratch approach am i taking an approach to this problem known to be bad is there a way to avoid using inspect that lets me use arbitrary strings to get values from a query result object some notes about the mcve i ve stripped down the number of orm objects the columns in each and the config information in the column lists the column lists are ugly in their original form where the double nested for loops are in the mcve there s a templating system in my actual code web server generating html all the usual fun has been stripped out to focus on sqlalchemy 	python

when we re constructing our app s view controller view architecture i believe i m using that word correctly as it concerns the relationships of objects and how they work together and what roles they play rather than what frameworks we use etc the view is a uiresponder and it receives touch events the view controller also receives those touch events but view controller is a controller object and responding to touch events is controller logic so the view controller should be responsible for knowing what to do depending on which view is touched right so is it better practice to put all the touch logic in view controller objects and not put it in the view object essentially ignoring the fact that views can respond to touches if we put all the logic in view controller objects is it a good idea to have a view controller object for each view that needs a fair amount of touch logic so instead of one view controller with a bunch of subviews as interface elements containing all the touch interaction code we have each sub view be the main view of its own view controller object and have all those view controllers be children of a parent view controller is that a good approach thanks for your help 	ios

i have an webapp which has a facebook log in and once a user logs in i store the user s access token in my db i also have subscribed for user feed using realtime api so when ever user adds a status or comments i would get callback from fb this would just tell me that there is a change i don t get the id of the comment or status so i have to query the graph api with the stored access token to get the feed and see what are the things that are updated so if i see that there is a new comment after the last query i had made i would process it is there any way to get the id of the comment or status that was made by the user and i the access token that i get expires in an hour so i can t query for data when there is a user update callback after an hour i also can t ask the user to go to my app again and re authorize since he won t use that app after log in i just need him to log in to my webapp so that i can get his access token is there any way to get the access token without the user having to go through the authorization phase again this is because user won t come to my app again after he logs in we just poll for his fb activities thanks 	java php

i have a couple of websites where i use a relatively small amount of jquery to do various things on the pages generally we re talking about a couple of dozen lines of code per page i keep all of my js in one file so far as it s not huge and fairly clearly defined that said what i have trended towards is organizing it like so document ready function var onpage1 id_thing_on_1 length 1 if onpage1 var usefulpage1function function blah a click function etc document ready function var onpage2 id_of_page_2 length 1 if onpage2 someclass fadein click function etc anything that is used on multiple pages gets taken out into a library but for page specific stuff this is the pattern i ve been following is there a better approach or is this an acceptable practice for keeping your js in one file and loading it on multiple pages 	javascript jquery

i was wondering if there was a way to insert multiple variables into a list at one time using the same index so for example let s say we have a list of a b c and 0 1 2 3 4 and i wanted to insert the first list such that the end result is a 0 1 b 2 3 c 4 but if i was going to do it individually using list insert pos value and used the positions of 0 2 4 then the subsequent positions used becomes invalid since it was relating to the old list of 5 elements instead of 6 now any suggestions 	python

i ve hit a brick wall in a project i m messing around with i ve got an adjacency list in a database where i ve got a series of nested categories it s in the format of id category parent_id and works quite well i d like to display it as a table so that people can add and alter categories without too much confusion this is where i m failing i can t for the life of me work out how to get it displaying correctly when i query the database i end up with a series of nested tuples similar to this 1l first none 2l second none 3l third none 4l fourth 1l 5l fifth 4l 6l sixth 3l 7l seventh 8l 8l eighth none the data gets changed a bit so there s no guarantee of order i assume i need some sort of recursive function to turn it into a table but i just can t get my head around it just something like this would be nice first fourth fifth second third sixth eighth seventh can anyone give me some pointers on how to achieve this it s almost impossible to get outside modules onto the box i m working on and it s only running python 2 5 so any help would be greatly appreciated edit before posting i d come up with the following code list 1l first none 3l third none 4l fourth 1l 6l sixth 3l 7l seventh 8l 8l eighth none 2l second none 5l fifth 4l levels levels append _ 0 for _ in list if _ 2 is none for x in xrange 0 len list 0 levels append for item in list levels 1 append item 0 if item 2 in levels 2 else none if sum len _ for _ in levels len list break from that i get nested lists for each level levels 1l 3l 8l 2l 4l 6l 7l 5l from here i get a little lost i assume to turn this into a table i need as many lists as there will be rows in the finished table i can find the longest list in the nest of lists to give the amount of rows it s working in two dimensions to fill the table out that s had me stumped the actual output is a non thing i can print the table in a way that suits me without much effort it s the thinking to create the table that s hurting me i know it s possible to do with sql queries such as in suggest sql query to retrieve all leaf nodes from adjacency list model i was just hoping there was a way to do it in python so i could learn more about handling this sort of data set 	python

in entity framework you can configure the relationship between your entities by either using data annotations inside the actual class entity public class entity key column order 0 public guid partofprimarykey get set key column order 1 public guid alsopartofprimarykey get set or by using the fluent api configuration modelbuilder entity lt entity gt haskey k gt new k partofprimarykey k alsopartofprimarykey give that you ve used the fluent api configruation approach how do you make sure the configuration is executed while mocking using moq the dbcontext for unit testing when i mock the dbcontext the method onmodelcreating is not being executed here is an explanation of how to test your application using a mocking framwork but it doesn t explain how they take care of the problem with configuring the entities other posts i have found doesn t address this issue either i guess there s something simple i m missing sidenote i m also aware of that it might not be a good idea at all to unit test your dbcontext because you will use linq to objects in your tests and linq to entites in production however i still think there is an answer to my question update if i use the data annotations instead it works fine 	c#

i have a strong issue while trying to play with doctrine single table inheritance i have a division entity which represents geographic divisions cities counties countries regions or any country specific administrative division for my application needs i need to specifically identify cities with a city entity cities being the widely shared administrative areas in the world it makes sense in my opinion here is what i basically want class division var boolean protected city class city extends division var boolean protected city true both being doctrine entities sharing the same table using the repositories i want to be able to get this behaviour return counties regions and cities but all mapped to division class divisionsrepositories gt findall return only cities mapped to city class citiesrepositories gt findall if id 12 is a division with city false returns null citiesrepositories gt find 12 persist to divisions table a row with city 1 citiesrepositories gt persist new city paris i ve played a lot with discriminators and couldn t find a way to get this result as the discriminator forces me to make a unique choice for division entity and so queries always get a city in 0 i even tried to create a loadclassmetadata event listener to override metadata but it breaks a lot of stuff in case of the question why is asked typehinting more accurate related entities relations specific repository and so better di lots of reasons any idea on how to reproduce this with doctrine it looks so simple that it makes me crazy edit here is one of the discriminatormap i ve tried as requested in comments orm table name divisions orm inheritancetype single_table orm entity orm discriminatorcolumn name city type integer orm discriminatormap 0 division 1 division 1 city abstract class abstractdivision 	php

i have created a require module and i when required the constructor should automatically take in any parameter value instantiate all the variables and functions and return that object to the file that called the required module i might not be explaining it correct so here is an example var test require testframework this works fine var socketio new require socketiotests test lt lt this does not work at the end of this socketio remains undefined the module exports on the socketiotest js file is simplified to var socketio function testframework var test testframework this somearray this testsockets function module exports socketio now as you can imagine because i am creating an object it is possible to do the following and it works exactly i expect var test require testframework var socketio require socketiotests var newobj new socketio test lt lt this works here the variable newobj returns with the object and public properties i expect but is there a way to cut this step out with something like var socketio new require socketiotests test i suspect this is either really straight forward and i need to learn javascript better or this isn t possible 	javascript

how does compiler ms visual c++ 2010 combine identical string literals in different cpp source files for example if i have the string literal hello world n in src1 cpp and src2 cpp respectively the compiled exe file will have only 1 hello world string literal probably in the constant readonly section is this task done by the linker what i hope to achieve is that i got some modules written in assembly to be used by c++ modules and these assembly modules contain many long string literal definitions i know the string literals are identical to some other string literals in the c++ source if i link my assembly generated obj code with the compiler generated obj code would these string literals be merged by the linker to remove redundant strings as is the case when all modules are in c++ 	c++

the same page e g http mobile nytimes com scrolls very slow on safari iphone but really fast in chrome adnroid but i found at least one page http www blick ch that scrolls very fast on iphones too how can i achieve the same effect for my page javascript solutions would be ok too 	javascript html
my problem comes with the navigation links endless scrolling i have included a delete button for each micropost when that button is pressed there s an ajax call to the server and the micropost is deleted and the div is removed from the dom say that i had microposts 1 to 10 on the first page microposts 11 to 20 on the second etc say that i delete items 1 2 and 3 on the first page then scroll dowmn the server will recalculate the microposts since i removed 3 of the previous list it will return items 13 to 22 in other words microposts 10 11 and 12 don t appear on the first page nor the second after hunting around on stackoverflow i found a solution whenever i delete a micropost from the list i load the micropost that came right after the last micropost on the page and inserted it at it at the bottom how i m currently going with the fix by default i show 10 microposts on a page using the will_paginate gem i need to know the id of any micropost displayed at any given time i achieve this by storing it in the opening div tag of for the container that holds each micropost lt microposts each do m gt lt div class postholder data micropost id lt m id gt gt i access it like this in my microposts js assets file function message_delete on ajax success function event data status xhr console log data to check if json is working console log postholder last data micropost id here is my controller destroy action def destroy micropost micropost find params id respond_to do format micropost destroy format json render json gt micropost just to check if json is working end end now i know the id of each micropost so when one is deleted i use a jquery selector to fine the last postholder div on the page get the id and then use that id to get the micropost that comes after it and insert that micropost after it this way when a message is deleted one is automatically appended if the user happens to scroll to load more messages none are missing i ve watched some railscasts and see ryan bates do similar things with using data attributes and have read a few things about them and seem to get the impression this is bad practice i ve tried to come up with other ways of doing this but can t think of any but doing it this way feels slightly strange maybe it s all in my head but i would like another better solution if possible thanks kind regards 	jquery

so i have an array the array has string values inside that can change each time var array 1 2 3 4 5 or sometimes var array 1 4 3 4 4 or even var array 1 3 3 4 4 how would i go about iterating through this array figuring out which value is present the most and then displaying it also how would i go about making it even smarter to understand that sometimes there is a tie between two values as is the case in the last array above and then displaying info notifying me that values 3 and 4 are tied or if there is no value that occurs more than once thus displaying all values thoughts 	javascript jquery
